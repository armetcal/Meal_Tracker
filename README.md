# Meal Tracker

This application is written for Android phones with an SDK of 36+, though it may work on some phones with an SDK of 24+.

Set different macromolecule goals for each day of the week, create a library of your own recipes, and use the meal logging function to track your day's intake. Progress bars indicate how close you are to hitting your macro goals. Easily track your intake over time using the calendar.
